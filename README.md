## Goal
Allow users to pay for an entire transaction without having to buy crypto on the original chain. 
By integrating Stripe and ERC-20 token support, users will not have to hassle with swap fees and can directly transact using an alternative payment method. 
After verifying the user's payment, the paymaster will then sponsor the entire transaction (value + gas) on the original chain.

## Applications
Our hackathon project aims to provide developers a React widget component that can be integrated within experiences such as NFT mints. This widget allows users to have an alternative
payment method readily available. Our widget integrates our ERC-4337 wallet features such as social sign-in to provide a frictionless experience.

## Why?
This component gives users a more familiar web2 experience by removing the need for a required wallet extension, visiting exchanges to swap tokens, etc. Users can simply interact with an on-site widget
and begin the transaction process without having to worry about external factors. Review total payment => Enter CC via Stripe or select held ERC-20 Tokens => Confirm Transaction
